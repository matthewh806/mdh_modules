# Bpm dancer

A module which functionally does nothing, but displays a nice dancing animation in time with the BPM.

With 1 pulse input (e.g. from a clock) we can iterate through an array of states which correspond to different dance positions.
In time with the bpm this should give the impression that the figure is dancing in time to the music.

## Posibilities:
    - Different characters to animate with different dance moves
    - Random iteration or sequential dancing
